# FIBONACCI GENERATOR

* The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, defined by a mathematical recurrence relationship. Examples; 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

## Running the Script

1. Iterative method

```bash
  python3 fibonacci_iterative.py
```

* To make the script executable:
```bash
  chmod +x ./fibonacci_iterative.py
```
* Then you can run your script directly like this:
```bash
  ./fibonacci_iterative.py
```

2. Recursive method

```bash
  python3 fibonacci_recursive.py
```

* To make the script executable:
```bash
  chmod +x ./fibonacci_recursive.py
```
* Then you can run your script directly like this:
```bash
  ./fibonacci_recursive.py
```

## Usage
* To get a fibonacci number in the fibonacci series, eg; the 6th value, indicate 6

```bash
  Fibonacci number: 6
```

* The script will generate the 6th fibonacci value in the fibonacci series.

```bash
  Fibonacci number 6 is: 8
```

# FIBONACCI GENERATOR

* The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, defined by a mathematical recurrence relationship. Examples; 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ...

## Running the Script

1. Iterative method

```bash
  python fibonacci_iterative.py  # OR: ./fibonacci_iterative.py
```
2. Recursive method

```bash
  python fibonacci_recursive.py  # OR: ./fibonacci_recursive.py
```

## Usage
* To get a fibonacci number in the fibonacci series, eg; the 6th value, indicate 6

```bash
  Fibonacci number: 6
```

* The script will generate the 6th fibonacci value in the fibonacci series.

```bash

## HANGMAN GAME

* Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word or phrase and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to be `hanged`.

* This program is a text-based version of the classic Hangman game. It uses a predefined list of words. Each player has only `6` guesses / attempts

## Running the Script

```bash
  python3 hangman_game.py
```
* To make the script executable:
```bash
  chmod +x hangman_game.py
```
* Then you can run your script directly like this:
```bash
  ./hangman_game.py
```

## Usage

You are prompted to guess a letter at a time within `6` guesses.

```bash
  Guess letter: [Input a letter]
```
